## Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting a detailed analysis of a microservice architecture system to assess its scalability on a specific software application.

1. **Objective**: Examine the scalability of a microservice architecture in terms of its ability to handle increased load and expand to accommodate growth.

2. **Scalability Attributes**: 

    - Performance
    - Load Scalability
    - Resource Utilization
    - Capacity
    - Fault Tolerance and Resilience

3. **Metrics for Scalability Analysis**:

    - Response Time
    - Throughput
    - Resource Usage
    - Error Rates
    - Latency
    - System Utilization
    - Service Time
    - Scalability Ratio
    - Queue Length
    - Availability

4. **Approach**: Develop a comprehensive methodology combining empirical testing with theoretical analysis.

5. **Expected Outcomes**: Detailed report including specific recommendations for improving scalability and general insights that can be applied to other microservice architectures.

6. **Target Audience**: Developers and organizations aiming to design more scalable microservice architectures.

## Current Limitations

Scalability analysis is usually done through a mix of load testing, code reviews, and architectural analysis. The current limitations include the time and expertise required to set up and interpret load tests, difficulty predicting future loads, and the challenge of identifying bottlenecks in complex systems.

## Proposed Solution

The plan is to improve upon current methods by setting up automated load tests that simulate different types of load increase, performing a detailed review of the system's code and architecture to identify potential bottlenecks. 

## Risks

Some risks include representativeness of the chosen system, incomplete identification of scalability issues, quality and availability of documentation, and technical complexities and unknowns.

## Project Timeline

The project is planned to be completed within 11 weeks.
